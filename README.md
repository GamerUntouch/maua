# Maua

## RUNNING ON RUNPOD FOR STABLE DIFFUSION
## Notes
```
This hypothetically should run on any system that has ubuntu. This was SPECIFICALLY written for the configuration that runpod uses for its secure cloud.
Remember to navigate to the /workspace/ folder in the directory before starting up a terminal.
Scripts are saved under opt/lib/python3.7/site-packages/maua/
I'm not entirely sure if it's a problem with jupityrlab, but stopping the VM seems to wipe the env, so you'll have to redo everything.
This was SPECIFICALLY setup to use with STABLE DIFFUSION, other functionality is likely not working and was not tested.
```

## Setup
### STEP 1
```
conda install cuda -c nvidia
```
```
apt update && apt install build-essential && apt-get install manpages-dev
```
The default config that RunPod uses does not play well with the library so this updates a bunch of stuff. Takes a considerable amount of time, sorry.

### STEP 2
Then,
```
pip install numpy Cython torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
```
```
pip install git+https://github.com/maua-maua-maua/maua.git --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
git clone https://github.com/maua-maua-maua/maua

cd maua
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Downloads all of the modules and submodules needed.

### STEP 3
Then,
```
pip install torchvision --upgrade
```
```
apt-get update && apt-get install libgl1 && apt-get install libglib2.0-0 && apt-get install libboost-all-dev && apt-get install mesa-common-dev
```
```
ln -s libboost_python37.dylib libboost_python3.dylib

python maua/submodules/pycuda/configure.py --cuda-enable-gl
mv siteconf.py maua/submodules/pycuda
pip install -e maua/submodules/pycuda

git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
cd apex
python setup.py install --cuda_ext --cpp_ext 
cd ..

pip install maua[flow]

cd maua
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
```
Compiles all of the modules. After this, you're good to go.

### Commands
```
python -m maua.diffusion.image --text "a prompt" --diffusion stable --sizes 512,512 --number 1 --timesteps 50 --sampler euler_ancestral --cfg-scale 5.0 --clip-scale 75 --seed 42
```


## üë∑ ‚õèÔ∏è WIP üõ†Ô∏è üë∑

Maua is a Python library (and command line interface) for synthesizing images, video, and audio using deep learning.

While many research groups publish code to reproduce results of their papers, it is often still time intensive to set up the environment correctly and figure out how to run the algorithms on your own data. The goal of Maua is to collect these methods in one place to make it easy to use them as creative tools. The primary design goal is composability. Combining different methods in unique ways exponentially expands the space of possible results--and so the creative freedom.

Maua is still under construction for now and so the API and functionality are subject to change.

## Installation

Deep learning is very compute hungry, this means that a decent GPU is practically a requirement. [Install CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and then Maua can be installed using pip as follows: 

```bash
pip install numpy Cython torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip install git+https://github.com/maua-maua-maua/maua.git --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
```

Currently installation has only been tested on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine with NVIDIA GPUs. Other configurations are also possible but might be more involved. If you're running into problems, feel free to open an issue!

### Compiling Extensions

```
python maua/submodules/pycuda/configure.py --cuda-enable-gl
mv siteconf.py maua/submodules/pycuda
pip install -e maua/submodules/pycuda

git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
cd apex
python setup.py install --cuda_ext --cpp_ext 
cd ..

pip install maua[flow]
```


## Usage

WARNING: some of the examples below might be out of date.

### Command line

Use --help to find the options available
```bash
python -m maua --help
python -m maua autoregressive --help
python -m maua.diffusion.sample --help
```

#### Examples

Generate images with classifier-free guided diffusion:
```bash
python -m maua.diffusion.sample --text "A street art mural of a dapper turtle with wings"
```

Generate images by finetuning RuDALL-E on a set of images:
```bash
python -m maua autoregressive ru finetune --input_dir /path/to/directory/of/images/
```

Upscale images using RealESRGAN:
```bash
python -m maua super image upscale /path/to/image.png /path/to/image2.png /path/to/image3.png --model_name RealESRGAN-pbaylies-hr-paintings
```

### Python

All of the command line functions are also available for import within python.

#### Examples

High resolution diffusion:
```python
from maua.diffusion.sample import main as diffusion
from maua.super.image import upscale

images = [diffusion(text="A street art mural of a dapper turtle with wings", timesteps=100) for i in range(5)]

for pil_image in upscale(images, model_name='latent-diffusion'):
    pil_image.save(f"output/{i}.png")
```

## Thanks

Thank you to everyone that makes their work available to the community. Maua incorporates open source code from all of the internet, without the work of these amazing people this wouldn't be possible. Below is a (probably very) incomplete list of people whose code has directly or indirectly contributed to Maua:

@crowsonkb, @ProGamerGov, @lucidrains, @dvschultz, @eps696, @l4rz, @caillonantoine, @ben-hayes, @adrienchaton, @sportsracer48, @afiaka87, @aydao, @rosinality, @genekogan, @dribnet, @alexjc, @htoyryla, @neverix, @sniklaus, @xinntao, @cszn, @JingyunLiang, @kentsyx, @kakaobrain, @yu45020, @twitter@advadnoun, @twitter@danielrussruss, @twitter@ai_curio

## Citations

Maua relies on many innovations coming directly from the research community. It's safe to say that if you use Maua in any way for research related purposes you should be citing some papers. For now, please do a quick web-search based on the file path (these are generally named after the method). A full list of papers to cite will be compiled and documented clearly in the future.

## License

The main license for this repository is GPL-v3. However, due to the wide variety of sources of code, different components might fall under different licenses. Efforts are still underway to ensure all parts of the Maua library are licensed and attributed correctly. If there are any issues with licensing please make an issue and they will be rectified ASAP!

The code is provided free of charge for the purpose of enabling people to make art and explore deep learning synthesis. Due to the aformentioned licensing, commercial use of Maua may be tricky. You will need to make sure that you are adhering to the licensing terms of all the submodules!

In general, output does not fall under the license of the code. Copyrights of model weights and model outputs are still a major gray area so use these commercially at your own risk! As a rule of thumb, try to consider if what you are making really is transformative. If you've simply scraped someone's social media page and trained a model to mimic them, you need to give them credit and should not use the model or outputs commercially without discussing with them.
